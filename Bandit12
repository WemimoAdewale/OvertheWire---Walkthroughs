# The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. 
# This file is written in hexadecimal characters.The binary was compressed multiple times. I had to restore the original file by undoing each layer until i got the plain text
xxd -r data.txt > data  
#used this to reverse the hexdump back into a binary file
file data
# i used this to check what type of file data was
#afterwards, i used different tools depending on what file returned. When it was gzip
gunzip data.gz
#when it returned bzip2
bzip2 -d fata.bz2
#when it returned tar
tar -xf data.
#this process was used iteratively until asci text was returned. The ascii text is the password for level 13.
